Introduction to DevOps :::

	What is DevOps?
	

	Software / Applications :
	
		- Desktop Applications
		- Web Applications 
		- Mobile Applications
		- Embedded Applications ( IoT)
		
	SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle:
	
	- Requirement Analysis 
	- Design & Documentation
	- Code / Develop
	- Test 
	- Implement to Production 
	- Maintain / Monitor
	
	Waterfall Model :
	
		- Top-Down Approach - Linear fashion
		- Monolith Application Architecture
		
		- Desktop Applications ::
		
			--> Retail Customer : Super-Market - Billing & Sales Management
									-> User Interface 
									-> Stock Mgmt
									-> Billing 
									-> Payment : CASH 
										--> Online/CASH/UPI/CARD
									-> Inventory Mgmt
				
		Core Project :
		
		- Requirement Analysis 			18-Months 
		- Design & Documentation
		- Code / Develop				7th Month 
		- Test 
		- Implement to Production 
		- Maintain / Monitor
		
		Enhancement Project : --> Online/CASH/UPI/CARD
		
		- Requirement Analysis 		
		- Design & Documentation	
		- Code / Develop			
		- Test 	
		- Implement to Production 	
		- Maintain / Monitor	

	
	AGILE Methodologies :
	
		- Based on Iterations:
			- Functions/Modules ==> Iterations
			
			
	Iteration1: User Interface design
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
		- Design & Documentation	
		- Code / Develop			
		- Test 	
		- Implement to Production with manual approvals	
		
		- Maintain / Monitor	
	
	Iteration2: Stock Mgmt
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
		- Design & Documentation	
		- Code / Develop			
		- Test 	
		- Implement to Production with manual approvals	 
		
		- Maintain / Monitor	
	
	
	Iteration nth: Online/CASH/UPI/CARD
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
		- Design & Documentation	
		- Code / Develop			
		- Test 	
		- Implement to Production with manual approvals	 
		
		- Maintain / Monitor
		
	
	Using AGILE Methodologies :
	
		We can able to achieve :
		
			- Continuous Development
			- Continuous Integration 
			- Continuous Testing 
			- Continuous Delivery 
				- It used to release the product/changes to production Environment
				- It expect the Manual Approvals.
			
		We cannot achieve :
		
			- Continuous Deployment
				- It used to release the product/changes to production Environment
				- It never expect the Manual Approvals.			
	
	What is DevOps? 
	
		DevOps is a Software Development Strategy, which promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Teams to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
	How to Implement DevOps?
	
	Identify the Teams involved in SDLC Process :
		
		- Infra-Structure Management Team 
		- Application Development Team 			Appln. Module 
		- Testing Team
		- Release Management Team 
		- Production Support Team 
		- Production Monitoring Team 
		- IT Security Management Team 
		
	Environments:
	
		Non-Prod Environments									Production Environments
		
			Dev Environment
			
			Build Environment	-- Install the Build Tools
			
			Test Environments
				- QA 
				
				- UAT 					=============>				Production Servers 		
			
	Application Architecture :	
	
		- Monolith Application Architecture
			- The Application components are tightly coupled with each other.
			- It is not possible to independently implement the changes to prod.
			- Here all the functions are defined on a single Application Routine.
			- With this we can just achieve Continuous Delivery		
		
		- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
		
			- The Entire Application is divided into Micro-Services 
			- Each Micro-Service can be independently developed and implement to prod.
			- With this we can achieve Continuous Deployment
			
			
		Web Application :
		
		sign-up
		
		sign-in 
		
		
	DevOps Stages :
	
		- Continuous Development :
		
			- It is capability of Application Team to Continuously develop the code changes for further implementation.
			- It aims to improve the Developers' productivity.
			
			Role of Application Developer :
			
				- To Create Application Source Code.
				
				- Create Source Code 
				- Manual Build (Is a process of Compiling the Source Code & Create Artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec))
				- Unit Testing 
				- Promote the Changes to Test Environment
				- Manually send the Email Notifications to Testing Teams
			
			Using DevOps Approach :

				- Create Source Codes 
				- Save/Commit the Source Codes in the Source Code Repository(GitHub/Azure Repo)
				
				Automate :
			
				- Build (Is a process of Compiling the Source Code & Create Artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec))
				- Unit Testing 
				- Promote the Changes to Test Environment
				- Send the Email Notifications to Testing Teams		

			Tools: 
				- IDEs - Eclipse/Pycharm/Eclipse Based IDEs - Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio
				- Git/GitHub/Azure Repo
				
		
		- Continuous Integration::

			- It is capability of Application Team to Continuously Integrate the code changes for further testing.

				Automate :
			
				- Build (Is a process of Compiling the Source Code & Create Artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec))
				- Unit Testing 
				- Promote the Changes to Test Environment
				- Send the Email Notifications to Testing Teams	
				
			Tools :
			
				- IDEs - Eclipse/Pycharm/Eclipse Based IDEs - Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio
				- Git/GitHub/Azure Repo
				- Jenkins / Azure Pipelines / Docker / Kubernetes / Ansible 

				
		- Continuous Testing::

			- It is capability of Testing Team to Continuously Test the code changes for further Implementation.
			
			Tools :
			
				- Junit/TestNG/Selenium
				- Jenkins/Azure Pipelines/Azure Artifacts/Azure Test 
				

		- Continuous Delivery / Deployment::

			- Both Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment are used to promote the changes to Production Environments.

			- Continuous Delivery :
			
				- It expect the Manual Approvals for Production Releases.
				- Expect Application Down-Time.

				Eg.:
				
					Online Banking : v1.0 ==> v2.0
					
						Open Production Release Window : 
						
							4 - 6 Hrs. (Application Downtime) - 
							
							Prod Testing ==> Fix the issue else revert the changes

						
			- Continuous Deployment :
			
				- It never expect the Manual Approvals for Production Releases.	
				- This can be achived only using Micro-Service Based Application Architecture.
				- Achieve Production Releases without any down-time.
		
				Eg.: amazon/facebook/netflix
						
						
			www.amazon.com 
			
			Sign-Up 			- Micro-Service1 - Developer1 - Independently Code - Integrate for further testing --> Release for Prod Environments
			Sign-In 			- Micro-Service2 - Developer2 - Independently Code - Integrate for further testing --> Release for Prod Environments

			- Tools :
			
				- Jenkins / Azure Pipelines / Azure Artifacts / 
				- Docker / Kubernetes / ACS / ACR / AKS 
				
		
		- Continuous Monitoring::
		
			- It used to ensure high availability of Applications and the Infra-Structure.		
			- To ensure business continueity
			
			- Infra-Structure Monitoring 
			
				- Azure Monitors / Dynatrace
			
			- Application Monitoring 
		
				- DataDog / AppDynamics

	Git/GitHub/AzRepos :::
	
	
	Source Code Management System: 
	
	Version Control System :
	
		- Is used version control the Source Code Changes --> (version number/tag/commit_id)
		- Is used to track the Changes 
		
	
	Types of Version Control System:

		Local Version Control System 

		Centralized Version Control System

		Distributed Version Control System: 
	
	
	
	
	Distributed Version Control System
	
		- GIT is the Open-Source Distributed VCS 
		- Is used version control the Source Code Changes --> (version number/tag/commit_id)
		- Is used to track the Changes 	
		- It is used to perform Parallel Development using Git Branching Techniques.
		
		- Using GIT Cli Command 
		
		
	GIT CLI commands :

		git push : push the latest changes from the local machine to remote git repository
		
		git pull : to download the latest changes from remote repo to local machine - keep the changes in-sync with the remote repo.
		

	Git Branches : 
		
		- It is used to perform Parallel Development without impacting others' changes.
		
		- Default Branch called (master/main)
			- It is considered as a production version of source code
		
	Git Branching Strategies :
	
		- Are used to maintain the integrity of the main/master branch
		
		
	Scenario 1 :
	
		Developer 
		
			Repository :
				
				master - c1,c2,c3
				
							c1,c2,c3,f1cm1,f1cm2			# Upon merging feature1 changes
				
					feature1 - c1,c2,c3
					
								- c1,c2,c3,f1cm1,f1cm2 -- merge to master 
								
								
	Scenario 2 :
	
		Developer 
		
			Repository :
				
				master - c1,c2,c3
				
							c1,c2,c3,c4			(c4 is upon merging changes from Developer_Branch)
				
					Developer_Branch : c1,c2,c3

			- It is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.
			
		Containers vs Virtual Machines 
		
		Virtual Machines (VM) :
		
			- VMs are Hardware level Virtualization 
			
			- VMs are created using Hypervisor 
			
			- VMs are used to execute the Operating System and its applications
			
			- VMs will be up and running even if there no active task or application
		
			- VMs consume more time and space to start the applications
		
		
		
		Containers :
	
		
			- Containers are OS level Virtualization 
			
			- Containers are created using Container-Engine 
			
			- Containers are used to execute the task/AppDynamics. NOT Operating System!
			
			- Containers will immediately go to exit state, if there no active task or application
		
			- Containers consume less time and space to start the applications
			
			- Containers are used to reduce the No. of VMs. We cannot completely eliminate VMs

	Build Environment :::
	
	
	
	git Cherrypick :
	
	git cherrypick <commit_id>
	
	git cherrypick <commit_id1> <commit_id2>
	
	- As per the best practise git cherrypick is not recommended to use.
	
	
	Containers :
	
		- Deploy the Containerized application using Kubernetes :
		
	
	- Containerization 
			- It is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.

	- Development/Deployment Perspective :
	
		- It is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.
		
		Scenario 1 :
		
			- Developer :
				- java program in my dev machine 
					- jdk 11, maven 				= Build the java program 
					- mywebapp.war 					- # artifact get created
					- Web Application Server(Tomcat/Nginx/httpd)
					- Unit Testing --- (jdk_11, tomcat_8.5)				
					- Deploy mywebapp.war to the Target Server 
					
				- Using Docker Containerization :
				
					- java program in my dev machine 
						- jdk 11, maven 				= Build the java program 
						- mywebapp.war 					- # artifact get created
						- Web Application Server(Tomcat/Nginx/httpd)
						- Unit Testing --- (jdk_11, tomcat_8.5)				
						- Use Docker Cli Commands to  package the application :
						
							Create package : (mywebapp.war | jd11,tomcat_8.5) ==> mywebapp_img
							
							- Publish images to dockerhub container registry
					
					
					
					
				- QA (VM)		mywebapp.war  
							- Using Docker CLI Commands, download the application Images to target servers.
							
							(mywebapp_dependencies | jd11,tomcat_8.5) ==> mywebapp_img
							
							- Using mywebapp_img Create Container and run the testing
							
							
					- jdk_8, tomcat_8
					
					- Used the application image: mywebapp_img.

		docker start <container_id>
		
		docker stop <container_id>
		
		Create Docker Images :
		
			- Docker Commit :
			
				- It is used create an Container Image based on the existing Container Reference.
				- Create Server Templates 
				- Reusable
				
				Syntax: 
				
					docker commit <Container_id> <DockerHub_Repository_Name>/<New_Docker_Image_Name>:<tag_Number>
					
				Eg.: 
				
					docker commit 4acef096ea94 loksaieta/edu-az-appbuildtemplate1:v1.0
				
				
			Publish the Image to Container Registry :
			
				- Create PAT in DockerHub 
			
				- docker login 
				
					Eg.: 
					
					docker login -u loksaieta
					
						
				- docker push 
				
					Eg.: 
					docker push loksaieta/edu-az-appbuildtemplate1:v1.0
				
				docker pull loksaieta/edu-az-appbuildtemplate1:v1.0
				
				
				
			- Docker Build	::::
			
				- It is used to Create a container Image based on the Dockerfile references
				- Dockerfile is a static file that define the properties of the Container
				- It composed of various instructions.
				- This Dockerfile will be created by the developers 
				- Dockerfile will be part of the source-code repository & used in cicd pipeline, during automate builds.
				
			How to Create a Dockerfile ?
			
			IAC - Server Templating / Configuration Management / Infra-Structure Provisioning 
					Docker/Vagrant		Ansible/Chef/Puppet			Terraform/CFT/ARM
			
			FROM 		# Used to Identify the Base Image.
			RUN 		# Excute the Package - apt 
			
			
			vi Dockerfile 
			
			FROM ubuntu
			RUN apt update -y
			RUN apt install git -y 
			RUN apt install maven -y 

			Syntax: 
				
				docker build -t <DockerHub_Repository_Name>/<New_Docker_Image_Name>:<tag_Number> .

			Eg.: 
			
				docker build -t loksaieta/edu-az-appbuildtemplate2 .			# "." Denotes the Dockerfile reference.
																				# Run the Docker Build Command from path of Dockerfile 
																				
																				
			Dockerfile Instructions :::
			
			
				FROM 			# Used to Identify the Base Image.
				
				RUN 			# Excute the Package - apt  
				
				COPY 			# To copy the file from the host volume to the container volume 
				
				CP				# To copy the file within the container volumes
				
				ADD 			# To copy the file from the host volume to the container volume as well as from the external URLs
									Eg.: wget <web-url>
									
				WORKDIR			# Setup the Current Working Directory 
				
				ENV 			# Setup the Environment Variable - PATH - JAVA_HOME 
				
				ARG 			# Pass the Input Parameters 
				
				CMD 			# It is used set the start-up task to the container.
								# It can be modified at run-time. 
																					
				ENTRYPOINT		# It is used set the start-up task to the container.
								# It cannot be modified at run-time.	

				EXPOSE			# To Setup the Container Port
				
			
	Use Case 1 :
	
	Setup - Self-Hosted Build Agent :
		
		Launch a VM 
		
		git --version 
		
		apt install openjdk-17-jre -y		

		apt install maven -y
		
		- Perform Application Build -- 
		
			- SCM Checkout 			https://github.com/Edu-az400-apr0525/java-webapp-project
			
			- Application Build 	--> Compile the Source Code / Perform Automated Unit Testing / Create Artifacts 
			
				Maven Goals :
				
					- mvn compile 	# Just compile the source-code
				
					- mvn test 		# To compile the source-code & Perform Automated Unit-Testing 
					
					- mvn package 	# To Compile,test and create artifacts in target folder
					
					- mvn clean		# To clean-up the target folder 
					
			- Application Image Build 		--> Create an Application Image using the Application Artifacts
			
			Dockerfile :
			
			FROM tomcat:8.0
